Kiwi TCMS Enterprise Edition
============================

This repository contains downstream build configuration for the
[Kiwi TCMS](http://kiwitcms.org) open source test case management
system, dubbed *Enterprise Edition*.

This is designed and supported by [Mr. Senko](http://mrsenko.com)
and thus differs from the upstream Docker image for Kiwi TCMS!

While the software itself is open source we do not provide public
access to the resulting `mrsenko/kiwitcms-enterprise` docker image.
This is available only to our subscribers.
See http://mrsenko.com/#subscriptions for more information.

If you want to use Kiwi TCMS free of charge head to http://kiwitcms.org!
